    <h1>Hunt The Wumpus</h1>

    <p>
      For too long now, your town has been victimized by the attacks of that terrible beast, the Wumpus. Determined
      to put a stop to it, you venture into the maze-like underground cavern where the Wumpus is known to live.
    </p>
    <p>
      You start out in a safe room in the cavern. Explore the maze by clicking the buttons to move up, down, left, or
      right. The maze is wrap-around in all directions so you can move off the edge on one side and you will appear on
      the other side. Be careful, because the cavern is filled with hazards:
    </p>
    <table>
      <tr>
        <td class="hazard-info">
          If you enter a room with <b>green walls</b> (as shown to the right), that means you are next to a slime pit. There
          are two slime pits in the cavern. Entering a slime pit will lead to a fatal fall.
        </td>

        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td class="hazard-info">
          The Wumpus' lair is in one of the rooms in the cavern. If you enter a room with <b>bloodspots</b> (as shown to the
          right), that means you are within <b><i>two</i></b> rooms of the Wumpus. Needless to say, do not enter the lair
          of the Wumpus or you will be eaten alive.
        </td>
        <td>
          <img src="/blood.png"/>
        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td class="hazard-info">
          If you enter a room with both green walls and bloodspots, that means you are next to a slime pit <b><i>and</i></b>
          within two rooms of the Wumpus. Take your next steps carefully!
        </td>
        <td>
          <img src="/blood-slime.png"/>
        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td class="hazard-info">
          Two of the rooms in the cavern are inhabited by giant bats. The first time you enter a room with a bat, you will
          awaken it. If you re-enter that room, it may fly you to another random room in the maze. The bat may even
          drop you into a pit or straight into the jaws of the Wumpus!
        </td>
        <td style="padding-left: 10px">
          <img src="/bat.png"/>
        </td>
      </tr>
    </table>
    <p>
      When you think you know where the Wumpus is, move into a room that connects to its lair and click the Shoot button.
      Fire the arrow into the tunnel that you think leads to the Wumpus. It doesn't matter if the tunnel is straight or not &mdash;
      the arrow will still follow the tunnel into the next cavern.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the cavern you fire into is the Wumpus' lair, you win! If you are wrong, you lose the game &mdash; your missed shot
      will likely wake the Wumpus, and you will be very lucky to get out of the cavern alive.
